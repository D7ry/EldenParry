#### How's the parry different from Zxlice's Backstab and Parry?

Zxlice's parry is done differently. <br>
It does not cancel the light bash hitframe.

The parry can be triggered by landing a bash <br>
on an attacking enemy at any time during their <br>
attacking animation.

IMO, this makes parrying way too easy <br>
and bashing only more overpowered.

In addition, Zxlice's parry is made only for melee <br>
attacks while Elden Parry works for projectiles too.

I wouldn't suggest enabling Zxlice's parry <br>
due to its overlapping functionality.

However, you can keep its backstab by <br>
turning the parrying option off in its MCM.
